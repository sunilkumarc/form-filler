## Form Filler

You know how annoying it is to fill fields like username, passwords, email id etc again and again on webpages in you daily work? Well, this chrome extension solves this problem by allowing you to save these information once and access them by just right clicking on an input field which you want to fill.

The extension is still in development phase. The extension currently doesn't work on some website because of Z-Index issues. This will be fixed soon.
